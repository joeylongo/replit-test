OBJECTIVE
Reverse-engineer how a human writer turned a set of key/value facts into the supplied Execution Details *and* how closely that transformation follows the official style guide and distill every rule needed to reproduce both the content and the HTML formatting.

REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION  ❱❱  Treat everything between the tags as canonical.
<<BEGIN_DOC>>
**Action Item Rules of Engagement **
Our associates should have no more than 10-12 Action Items at a time
If you have activity spanning multiple months, a new AI should be submitted for each month of execution
Action Items should always describe the 5 Ps: Product, Package, Point of Sale, Price and Placement
For MSC Action Items, detail necessary products/packages necessary for execution
Action Item Prioritization should encompass:
Customer initiatives and price promotions
Channel Big Bets
Market Street Challenge priorities
Incremental Brand Partner AIs  
Use AIs to verify POS execution IF there is a price promo and should include execution direction
For example, “Execute ordering extra inventory to support Peace Tea promotion 2/$2.50 supported by poster”
Include process for replacement POS or refusal to execute
Product allocations should be considered prior to submitting an action item. If possible, include a replacement product should something be out of stock
HQM vs. LSI: If the action item requires a selling conversation with a store manager, it is an LSI
For example, a coop might have Core Power in a POG progression, but the product still needs to be sold at the outlet level
Segment HQM action items when activity is store specific

**“PicOS” Look of Success**
Action Item verbiage (Execution Details) must clearly detail the intended execution, including Brand, Package, Point of Sale, Price and ideal Location
For example, “Sell in 4x3 Merchandising Rack and/or display in the perimeter with 2L Fanta flavors at 4/$5. Activate with Fanta Halloween graphics from the POS Store."
Detail MSC specific brands/packages when applicable
For example, “Execute a 12 Pack end with including Coke, Diet Coke, Coke Zero Sugar, Sprite and Fanta Orange at 3/$12. Wing 6 Pack ½ Liter at 2/$6. Activate Big Game POS from the POS Store.
Include baseline MSC Score in Verify
Include appropriate naming conventions (see details)
Every action item should include a picture of the desired execution
Priority HQM and ALL LSI action items should include a Sell Sheet:
Detail “Why”: Why this product? Why this program/messaging? Why this location?
Where possible, include product margin
Include link to appropriate POS on POS Store (Key Account folder or General Market  Program folder)

INPUT
• data           → a flat JSON object of key/value pairs representing a merchandising Activity
• Exeuction Details      → one paragraph of merchandising copy

OUTPUT
Return a natural language guide in Markdown on how to turn the data into a good Execution Details paragraph.
Your response will be used as a system prompt for a copywriter agent so optimize it for consumption by another LLM.
The copywriter agent will be given data AND execution details and will be responsible for generating better Execution Details using your guidance.

GUIDELINES
• Your guide should be general and apply to any incoming data.
• Your guide should not expect that data values will always be he same so should handle any scenario.
• Derive every statement strictly from evidence in the current paragraph.  
• Do **not** invent or hallucinate rules that are not justified by this example.  
• Be terse but precise; each transformation or omission rule should fit on one line.  
• Never reproduce the full paragraph or the raw data in the output—only the analytical JSON above.
`
// Return only these 6 properties, nothing else.
// Return exactly these 6 properties:

// 1. "field_usage": for every key in the data object, state:
//       • "present":   true/false     (does the paragraph mention it?)
//       • "representation":           (the exact phrase or transformed form in the paragraph, or "" if absent)
//       • "notes":                    (e.g., “abbreviated”, “combined with PackSize”, “implicit in price”)

// 2. "ordering_rules": an ordered array showing the sequence in which **present** fields appear in the paragraph, using the original keys (e.g., ["Action", "PackSize", "Product", "Location", "PromoPrice"]).

// 3. "transformation_rules": array of concise rules (imperative English) that explain
//       • renaming (“ProductName → short brand nickname”)
//       • consolidation (“PackSize + UnitVolume merged; UnitVolume omitted”)
//       • formatting (“price rendered as ‘$4.99’ ”)
//       • punctuation or casing conventions.

// 4. "omission_rules": array of reasons certain keys were left out or treated as implicit
//       • redundancy (“UnitVolume redundant with PackSize”)
//       • lack of relevance (“ExpirationDate not needed for in-store display”).

// 5. "template": rewrite the paragraph with each field replaced by {{KeyName}} tokens, preserving the discovered word order, connectors, and punctuation.  
//    Example → "Execute {{PackSize}} {{Product}} display at {{Location}}; promo {{PromoPrice}}; deploy {{Materials}}."

// 6. **"html_format_rules"** : array of concise, imperative rules that explain the markup conventions observed in the paragraph, e.g.  
// • “Wrap entire paragraph in \`<p>\`.”  
// • “Insert \`<br>\` between location and promo lines.”  
// • “Render price in \`<strong>\`; no additional inline styles.”  
// • “Use sentence-case text; no \`<h>\` tags.”
